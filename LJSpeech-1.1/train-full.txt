LJ012-0028|that he was soon admitted to be one of the best judges known of all kinds of property, from a glass bottle to a five hundred guinea chronometer.
LJ006-0106|Too much was left to the wardsman. It was he who could issue small luxuries;
LJ019-0254|they were frequently below the standard size, and were therefore not certified for occupation as was required by law.
LJ015-0314|He was in person a short, square-built man of gentlemanly address, sharp and shrewd in conversation and manner.
LJ004-0195|Personal cleanliness was insisted upon, and all parts of the prison were kept scrupulously clean.

LJ042-0028|Oswald had managed to save enough money to cover the expenses of his forthcoming trip.
LJ017-0274|When the warder went in to call him he asked for his clothes. He was told he would have to wear his own.

LJ043-0032|After about a 2-week separation, Marina Oswald returned to her husband.
LJ028-0117|My father built the moat-wall of the Arachtu canal securely with mortar and bricks.

LJ035-0206|An eyewitness to the shooting immediately provided a description of the man in the window which was similar to Oswald's actual appearance.
LJ017-0068|and public opinion at the termination of the trial coincided with the verdict of the jury.

LJ001-0085|It was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are positively ugly, and which, it may be added,
LJ024-0081|But we cannot yield our constitutional destiny to the personal judgment of a few men who, being fearful of the future,
LJ003-0227|So unjust and unequal was the system, that the allowance to convicted criminals was better than that of the innocent debtor,
LJ008-0055|for that city claims the priority in establishing the custom of hanging criminals at the jail itself.
LJ019-0228|it also contained eleven reception cells, six punishment cells, and a couple of cells for condemned criminals.
LJ019-0256|Still greater were the differences with regard to employment. The various authorities held widely different opinions as to what constituted hard labor.
LJ030-0070|Motorcycles. -- Four motorcycles, two on each side, flanked the rear of the Presidential car.
LJ038-0171|General Walker gave this information to the police before the shooting, but it did not help solve the crime.
LJ032-0200|One Sunday, while his wife was hanging diapers, Oswald asked her to take a picture of him holding a rifle, a pistol
LJ005-0160|It was plain that although the law had defined general principles of prison government,
LJ017-0284|was too much for his nerves, and he so nearly fainted that he had to be seated in a chair.
LJ012-0131|The letter informed him of the marks and sizes of the cases containing the precious metal,

LJ033-0041|After dinner Ruth Paine and Marina Oswald were busy cleaning house and preparing their children for bed.
LJ005-0235|Last, and worst of all, the arrangements for keeping the condemned prisoners between sentence and execution were more than unsatisfactory.
LJ011-0139|This time they sent back the bill, re-enacting only the two penalties for will forging and the forging of powers of attorney;
LJ014-0323|The warrant thus represented money, and was often used as such, being endorsed and passed from hand to hand as other negotiable bills.
LJ005-0171|we shall find but few which have not in one or other of these ways removed the grievance of which such just complaint is made.

LJ009-0237|the poor criminal rose straight upon his feet, with the hangman on his shoulders, and immediately loosened the rope with his fingers.
LJ005-0234|The visits of friends was once more unreservedly allowed, and these incomers freely brought in extra provisions and beer.
LJ002-0333|a severe winter set in, the new stock had not been supplied by the contractors, and the poor debtors perished of cold.

LJ033-0019|According to the testimony of Frazier, Marina Oswald, and Ruth Paine, it appears that Oswald never returned to Irving in midweek
LJ018-0232|He himself prepared it on a blank form which he had brought with him on purpose.
LJ034-0209|the Commission has considered the allegation that Oswald was photographed standing in front of the building when the shots were fired.
LJ012-0049|led him to think seriously of trying his fortunes in another land.
LJ041-0155|He always wanted to play the red pieces in chess because, as he said in an apparently humorous context,
LJ028-0363|and there on June 13, 323 B.C., he met his death.
LJ016-0360|The change added greatly to the responsibilities of the governor and his subordinates. Hitherto the public had seemed to assist at the ceremony;
LJ031-0078|At approximately 1 p.m., after last rites were administered to the President by Father Oscar L. Huber, Dr. Clark pronounced the President dead.
LJ027-0050|Homology thus means identity of structure which is the result of identity of parentage. It is the stamp of heredity.
LJ038-0279|I think is going overboard in the other direction.
LJ034-0110|Oswald was 5 foot 9 inches, slender and 24 years old.
LJ010-0194|but gazed with complacency around the crowded court, and eagerly inquired what persons of distinction were present.
LJ013-0234|The cloth above referred to belonged to the inner seam of his trousers, which he had managed to tear out.
LJ047-0241|that the FBI had known about Oswald and, in particular, of his presence in Dallas and his employment at the Texas School Book Depository Building.
LJ035-0029|Neither elevator was there.
LJ028-0064|In 597, when he sent his army to Jerusalem, he won the hatred of the Jews by taking Jehoiakin, the King, captive.

LJ046-0119|as obtaining clearance of some categories of White House employees and all tradesmen who service the White House,
LJ001-0034|They printed very few books in this type, three only; but in their very first books in Rome, beginning with the year 1468,
LJ010-0274|Much the same motives of seeking notoriety seem to have impelled Bean, who was perfectly sane, to his rash act;

LJ014-0043|Hocker's conduct in Newgate while under sentence of death was most extraordinary.

LJ007-0063|It is only fair to Mr. Cotton to add that, according to his own journal, he was unremitting in his attentions to convicts who were actually cast for death,
LJ003-0043|and it was not ready to relieve Newgate till late in 1815.
LJ041-0135|In that connection, it should be noted that Marina Oswald testified on September 6, 1964, that she thought her husband, quote,

LJ034-0120|the police radio reported that, quote, an eyeball witness, end quote, described the suspect in the Tippit shooting as, quote, a white male,

LJ048-0005|There was nothing up to the time of the assassination that gave any indication that this man was a dangerous character who might do harm to the President

LJ016-0017|John Williams, a young fellow only twenty-three years of age, awaited execution in 1827 for stealing in a dwelling-house.
LJ002-0168|The lad in question was found in Coldbath Fields prison, to which he had been sent for a month in default of paying a fine of forty shillings.
LJ012-0226|This trial came off in due course at the Central Criminal Court, where the prisoners were charged on two counts,

LJ031-0014|the Presidential limousine arrived at the emergency entrance of the Parkland Hospital at about 12:35 p.m.
LJ038-0172|Although the bullet was recovered from Walker's house, in the absence of a weapon it was of little investigatory value.
LJ012-0186|The crime was brought home to Thurtell by the confession of Hunt,

LJ028-0234|Cyrus was now reduced to great perplexity, as time went on and he made no progress against the place.
LJ008-0009|But the Old Bailey was not exclusively used;
LJ007-0213|Again the following year the inspectors repeat their charge.
LJ007-0227|The inspectors were not to be deterred, however, by any opposition from the earnest discharge of their functions, and continued to report against Newgate.

LJ044-0100|Following the disclosure of his defection, Oswald sought advice from the Communist Party, U.S.A., concerning his Fair Play for Cuba activity.
LJ047-0222|He had made the same statement about a week prior at another special conference which we had held.

LJ044-0191|Now there appeared to be no chance to get to Cuba, where he had thought he might find his communist ideal. The U.S. Government would not permit travel there
LJ027-0147|For as it is of the essence of this theory that new forms arise from older forms by way of hereditary descent,
LJ050-0268|The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.

LJ046-0250|The requests shifted the responsibility for evaluating difficult cases from the Service, the agency most responsible for performing that task,

LJ002-0034|5. The master felons' side. 6. The female felons' side. 7. The state side.

LJ045-0028|he and his wife spent every weekend but one together at the Irving, Texas home of Mrs. Ruth Paine, who was then separated from her husband.
LJ041-0017|Voebel also recalled that Oswald once outlined a plan to cut the glass in the window of a store on Rampart Street and steal a pistol,

LJ038-0154|Shelley denied seeing Oswald after 12 noon or at any time after the shooting.

LJ035-0205|and no one could be found who saw Oswald anywhere else in the building until after the shooting.
LJ015-0086|He kept open house at Kilburn Priory;

LJ014-0002|Hocker's murder is in its way interesting, as affording another proof of the extraordinary way in which the culprit returned to the scene of his guilt.
LJ016-0131|Nothing more was heard of Krapps. The curious thing in his case was that his offense was a trifling one;
LJ035-0210|On the basis of these findings the Commission has concluded that Oswald, at the time of the assassination,

LJ017-0134|Within a few weeks occurred the Leeds poisoning case, in which the murderer undoubtedly was inspired by the facts made public at Palmer's trial.
